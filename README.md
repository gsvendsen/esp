#### Introduction

For my final exam work at Yrgo I decided to create an app in React Native with the purpose to create a user-friendly experience for finding new music. What makes the app different is it uses your current existing playlists as a source for new recommendations. In a Tinder-like flow you easily can preview a new song recommendation and decide wether to keep it in your targeted playlist or to go to the next recommendation.

### Build Process

Esp was built with React Native and the Expo API. For the music recommendation data I used the Spotify recommendation API and the user API in order for the app user to select their source playlists for the recommendation feed.
